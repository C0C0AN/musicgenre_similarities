# Nothing compares to you - music genre perception similarities across modalities in humans and machines"

This is the repository for the multimodal project "Nothing compares to you - music genre perception similarities across modalities in humans and machines" which focused on the perception of music genres and their similarities in both biological and artificial networks. In more detail, participants were presented with a diverse set of music excerpts from 20 different genres while they underwent fMRI or EEG, furthermore arranging the same excerpts in a multiarrangement task. In addition to extracting acoustic features from the music excerpts, their respective cochleagram was processed by a pre-trained DNN tasked with predicting the respective genre. Furthermore, a broad set of general, auditory and music related information was assessed from the participants.  

The project comprised 5 distinct parts:

#### The dataset

Following open and reproducible (neuro-)science practices, the entire dataset was made publicly available [here]() and is described in detail [here](). The dataset is additionally version controlled through [DataLad]() and the corresponding analysis steps outlined in the dataset paper are reproducible through the respective DataLad functionality. The steps are  broadly summarized at the project's [protocol.io page]() and the code is available [here](). 


#### Spatial aspects using fMRI


#### Temporal aspects using EEG


#### Behavioral aspects using IMDS


#### Computational aspects using DNN
